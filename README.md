## (12/30/2024) Progress:
### Added an Enemy with simple tracking and attack logic, animation is also avaliable. Fixed collision issue for all game objects. Corin and Nicole move sets are updated(excluding switchInAttack, switchInEXAttack, and rush attack). Stay on field mech: The character will finish their move before switchOut.
Most of the time I spend in the last two days are dealing with the problem generated by new animations. Since most animations come from the internet with different sources, they function a little different and I just have to keep adjust back and forth. I also included a prototype for health and attack, but not done.

## (12/28/2024) Progress:
### Added branch attacks, now can customize different combos for different characters. Team system is finally avaliable, switchIn, switchOut logic is fixed. Implemented input buffer for branch attack and branch normal attack for smoother transitions.
Still need implementation(priority from high to low): Ult close up shot(done); holding down moves(done); Bullet system; Enemy(done); energy and ult calculation system; health & break system; switch in attack; apply all moves to all character in game; stage/victory or loss scene; (if I have enough time and energy for the following (tears)) attack special effects; render

## (12/26/2024) Progress:
### Connecting move sets, working on the state machine mech, fixed switchIn and switchOut logic and presentation, added switch character cool down
A known problem is that if switch character too fast, it might shift to a different place(worst if there is an object near by). My guess is that when switch too fast, switchOut animation is not entirely played and gameObject will not be properly turn off causing some variables wrong. But switch character cool down is not smooth for the game play.
Improvements: Smoother switch character cool down, character will finish doing what ever has left for them to do on the field.(done)

## (12/25/2024) Progress:
### Move sets: Ult, evade, normal attack, idle, idle_afk. Still working on: skill, follow-up attack.
Can switch between different state. Have a working state machine at this point. Evade has a one sec cool down for every for consecutive evades.
Still Need Improvements: Be able to cancel certain moves using evade.(done)


## (12/24/2024) Progress:
### Adjust Animation
Enable Nicole Humanoid Avatar, Attached weapons to the character
Basic movement update & animation manage & state change for Nicole's game play.
